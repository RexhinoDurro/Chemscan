CHEMSCAN - Executive Overview 🧪🎯 What Is It?CHEMSCAN is a "Photomath for Chemistry" - an AI-powered Progressive Web App that helps students, lab technicians, and chemists:

Scan handwritten chemical equations and instantly extract formulas
Calculate stoichiometry (moles, masses, limiting reagents, yields)
Identify safety hazards and get prevention tips
Generate complete lab procedures with equipment lists and step-by-step instructions
Think: Take a photo of your chemistry homework → Get calculations + safety warnings + lab instructions in seconds.❓ What Problem Does It Solve?Current Pain Points:
Manual calculations are slow and error-prone

Students spend 30+ minutes per problem doing math
One mistake early = entire calculation wrong



Lab prep is tedious

Looking up safety info across multiple sources
Creating equipment lists manually
Writing procedures from scratch



Safety information is scattered

Hard to know what's dangerous
Easy to miss hazard warnings
Students make preventable mistakes



Existing tools are limited

Calculators don't understand chemistry notation
No OCR for handwritten equations
No integrated safety checking
No lab procedure generation

Provides:

What can go wrong
How to prevent it
Required safety equipment
Emergency procedures
Example:
Reaction: HCl + NaOH
⚠️ CAUTION: Exothermic Reaction
- Heat released during mixing
- Can cause splattering
Prevention: Add slowly, use ice bath
PPE: Goggles, gloves, lab coat5. 🔬 Lab Procedure GeneratorCreates complete lab instructions:Title: Hydrochloric Acid-Sodium Hydroxide Neutralization

Safety Precautions:

Cleanup:
- Neutralize waste
- Rinse equipment
- Dispose properlySaves 1-2 hours of prep work!🔄 How It Works (User Flow)Scenario 1: Homework Help1. Sarah has chemistry homework
   "Balance: Fe + O₂ → Fe₂O₃"
   "If you have 10g Fe, how much O₂ needed?"

2. She writes it on paper

3. Opens ChemScan → Scan Mode

4. Takes photo with phone camera

5. App extracts:
   ✓ Reactants: Fe, O₂
   ✓ Products: Fe₂O₃
   ✓ Given: 10g Fe

6. App calculates:
   ✓ Balanced: 4Fe + 3O₂ → 2Fe₂O₃
   ✓ Fe: 10g = 0.179 moles
   ✓ O₂ needed: 0.134 moles = 4.29g
   ✓ Fe₂O₃ produced: 0.089 moles = 14.29g

7. Sarah verifies work, learns the process

8. Downloads calculation as PDF for submission

⏱️ Time: 2 minutes (vs. 20 minutes manually)Scenario 2: Lab Preparation1. Ahmed is prepping for tomorrow's lab
   Experiment: Titration of H₂SO₄ with NaOH

2. Opens ChemScan → Type Mode

3. Enters: "H2SO4 + NaOH"
   Adds: "0.05M H2SO4, 25mL"

4. App shows:
   ✓ Balanced equation
   ✓ NaOH needed: 0.1g
   ✓ Safety warnings

5. Clicks "Get Lab Procedure"

6. AI generates complete procedure:
   ✓ Equipment list
   ✓ Step-by-step instructions
   ✓ Safety precautions
   ✓ Expected results

7. Ahmed reviews, downloads PDF

8. Goes to lab prepared and safe

⏱️ Time: 5 minutes (vs. 45 minutes planning)Scenario 3: Safety Check1. Teacher Maria planning demo
   Reaction: Na + H₂O

2. Enters into ChemScan

3. App immediately shows:
   🔴 DANGER: Violent Reaction
   - Sodium is water-reactive
   - Produces hydrogen gas (fire risk)
   - Can cause explosions
   
   Prevention:
   - Use very small amounts (< 0.1g)
   - Safety shield required
   - Fire extinguisher ready
   - Students behind barrier

4. Maria decides to use a video instead
   (Too dangerous for classroom)

⏱️ Prevented potential accident!
